## How long did it take you to finish it?
A little more of 5 hours. Majority of time was focused on style customization (CSS). 

## What would you have done if time permitted?
- I would add an autocomplete on input box.
- I would put, based on user writing, a list of suggestions, so user could clic it an automatically add at the official list.
- I would make a testing automation.
